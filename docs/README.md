# Chat-Bot 🤖

Welcome to the Chat-Bot project! This repository contains a sophisticated chatbot implemented in Go, utilizing WebSocket for real-time communication and Redis for session management. Whether you're looking to integrate a chat feature into your app, learn about WebSocket communication, or explore natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this project has something for you.

## Features 🌟

- **Real-Time Communication**: Uses WebSocket to facilitate real-time messaging.
- **Session Management**: Integrates Redis to manage and maintain user sessions effectively.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Leverages the `prose` library to parse and understand user inputs.
- **Docker Support**: Includes Dockerfiles for easy deployment and scalability.

## Getting Started 🚀

Follow these instructions to get your Chat-Bot up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Docker and Go installed on your machine. You can check by running:

```bash
docker --version
go version
```

Absolutely! Let's integrate Terraform into the setup steps of your `README.md` to reflect how you manage infrastructure. Here’s how you can adjust the installation section:

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://yourrepositoryurl.com/chat-bot.git
   cd chat-bot
   ```

2. **Initialize Terraform**

   Navigate to the `terraform` directory and initialize the Terraform configuration:

   ```bash
   cd terraform
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Apply Terraform Configuration**

   Apply the Terraform configuration to spin up your infrastructure:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   Confirm the plan by typing `yes` when prompted.

   Ensure your Terraform configurations include the necessary provisioning for these services if not running locally.

```

This section now includes steps for setting up Terraform which will manage the infrastructure needed for your application, assuming you have relevant definitions in your Terraform files. If your Terraform setup also handles Docker deployments, you might adjust these instructions accordingly.

### Usage

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to start interacting with the Chat-Bot.
